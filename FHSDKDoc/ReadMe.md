To generate API docs, you need to install SandCastle Help File Builder from http://shfb.codeplex.com/releases/view/105809.

During the installation process, make sure it installs the VS extension package.

Once finished, just build the project in Visual Studio to generate API docs.

By default, this project won't be built when the solution is built. You need to select the project and explictly build this project.
